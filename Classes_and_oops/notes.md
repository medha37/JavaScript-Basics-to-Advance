# javascript and classes
- JavaScript doesn't have traditional classes like some other languages do, but we can create objects using constructor functions or ES6 classes.
## OOP

## why use OOP

## parts of OOP
Object literal 

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)
- new :
1. In JavaScript, the new keyword is used to create instances of user-defined object types, often referred to as constructor functions or ES6 classes.
2. When you use new with a constructor function or a class, it creates a new object and sets this to refer to that new object within the constructor or class.
- this:
1. In JavaScript, this is a special keyword that refers to the current context, typically the object that owns the currently executing code.
2. The value of this depends on how a function is called. It is not lexically scoped like variables.
